CheckDependency:    A program that determines if a given file declares a cyclic dependency.
                    Input:      A name or a path to a text file.
                    Process:    Validates input, if the input is valid the program starts to analyze
                                the text file for determine if there is a cyclic dependency.
                                It first process all the data in the given file, and store it in the
                                memory, then it uses all the processed data to analyze the
                                dependency. If the file is invalid the program ends with an
                                error message.
                                Algorithm Description:
                                In order to determine cyclic dependency, the program use the
                                DFS Algorithm. The program stores in an array all the Files that
                                appeared in the file. Each File is a struct which holds it's
                                dependencies. Using this array of Files, the algorithm can use
                                DFS as learned in DaSt lessons. We create another 2 arrays -
                                'visited' and 'current'. If a File is in 'visited' it means
                                we visited it and also all of it's neighbours, so all the Files
                                in 'visited' are irrelevant for the continue of the Algorithm.
                                If the File we are currently called DFS on is in 'current' array,
                                we can determine that there is a cycle and finish the run.
                    Output:     A message that states the cyclic dependency result, if the input
                                was valid. An error message in case of bad input.
MyLinkedList:       A program for a Linked List data structure and support several operations on it.
                    Input:      No particular input.
                    Process:    The program handles the entire process of several operations on a
                                Linked List. The user is revealed only to a Pointer for a
                                Linked List, and all the Data Structure and the functions
                                implementation are hidden.
                    Output:     Depends on the specific driver that used these operations.

==================
=  Answers:      =
==================
1.  The disadvantages of implementing the MyLinkedList struct in the 'MyLinkedList.h' is that it
    does not satisfy a modular program, i.e. everyone that will use 'MyLinkedList.h' will be forced
    with the implementation of the given MyLinkedList struct.
    Therefore the header file does not stand as an interface that only declaring the struct but
    leaves to the user the freedom to change it's implementation, which is poor modularity.
    For example, whenever the implementation of the struct is due to
    change, all the users of MyLinkedList.h need to update their program to the change.
    Also, when implementing the MyLinkedList struct in the 'MyLinkedList.h', we share our
    implementation to all the users who use this header file, and by that hurting the encapsulation
    of our program, and the Information Hiding Principle.

2.  The compilation succeed because it doesn't really need to know the size of MyLinkedList struct,
    it only define a Pointer to that struct, and the size of Pointer, which is known
    at compile time as we learned, does not depend on the size of the object it points to.
    Moreover, even if it was a declaration of the struct itself, the compilation is going to succeed
    because this part of finding the struct implementation and allocating memory for it is part
    of the Linkage, which comes after the Compiling (and Pre-Processor) phase.
    In our case, the struct implemented in the .c file is in the same translation
    unit with the .h file. In case of no implementation for this struct, we will receive a
    Linkage error and not compiler error.
